Triangle Puzzle
===============

This project is a JavaScript implementation of the puzzle of finding the maximum sum of a triangle lattice of numbers and displaying the solution path(s). The brute force method would require a computationally infeasible NP algorithm. However there is a much more efficient method that is polynomial time.
